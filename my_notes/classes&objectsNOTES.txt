CLASSES
    - Blueprint from which objects are created
    - User-defined data type
    - Has attributes (data)
    - Has methods (functions)
    - can hide data and methods
    - provides a public interface

    EXAMPLES OF CLASSES
    - Account
    - Employee
    - Image
    - std::vector
    - std::string


OBJECTS 
    - Created from classes 
    - represents a specific instance of a class 
    - can create many objects
    - each has its own identity
    - each can use the defined class method 

    EXAMPLES OF OJBJECTS (Account class)
    - Duru's account is an instance of an Account
    - Ulan's account is an instance of an Account

DECLARING A CLASS AND CREATING OBJECTS

class Class_Name
{
    // declarations
}

example:
class Player
{
    // attributes
    std::string name;
    int health;
    int xp;

    // methods
    void talk(std::string text_to_say);
    bool is_dead();
}

Player duru;
Player hero;

// creating a player using a pointer and dynamic memory
Player *enemy = new Player();
delete enemy;

// creating an array/vector of a class objects
vector<Player> team_one {duru};
players1.push_back(hero);
