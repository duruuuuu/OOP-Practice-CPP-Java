CONSTRUCTORS
    - Special member method
    - invoked during object creation
    - useful for initialization
    - same name as the class
    - no return type is specified
    - can be overloaded


    DESTRUCTOR
        - Special member method 
        - Same name as teh class proceeded with a tilde (~)
        - Invoked automatically when an object is destroyed
        - No return type and no parameters
        - Only 1 destructor is allowed per class [CANNOT BE OVERLOADED!]
        - Useful to release memory and other resources

        EXAMPLE (for Player Class)

    class Player
    {
    public:
        // Overloaded constructors 
        Player();
        Player(std::string name);
        Player(std::string name, int health);

        // destructor
        ~Player();
    }

    *Destructor is called when you use the delete fxn
    *IDE provides default, empty constructors and destructor if you do not write one yourself
