MASTERMIND is a game where the user has to guess a generated number.
THe number can be randomly computer generated or the user can enter a specific number.

RULES OF THE GAME:
1. The number to be guessed must have no more than 10 digits.
2. Each digit must be >= 9, and no digit can be repeated.

GAME PLAY:
1. If you would like to get a computer-generated number, enter the following:
        
        "mastermind -r <# of digits>"
        
        example:
        mastermind -r 4
        
        The example above generates a 4-digit number, (example: 1234, 2947, etc.)

        "mastermind -u <number>

        example:
        mastermind -u 54762309

3. For computer generated numbers, be sure to add a valid number of digits.
   For user generated numbers, make sure that the number entered is valid.

   You have a maximum of 100 guesses.
   Make sure that the number you enter when guessing is the correct number of digits.

5. When you enter a guess, the computer will provide you with two numbers:
    The first number will be the amount of digits in the correct position
    The second number will be the amount of digits that are in the secret number but in the wrong position

    (Secret number is 10348)
    User enters >>    10584
    Computer says >>  2 2
